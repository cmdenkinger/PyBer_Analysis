# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze data from Pyber by city type (Urban, Suburban< and Rural). The final results are a multi-lone graph showing the total weekly fares by city type.
This data will be used to help improve Pyber's ride sharing services as well as help develop improvements in areas with low usage in the areas represented.
## Results

As we can see in this image: 
- Urban areas have the highest number of drivers and rider and therefore the highest amount of total fares. 
- Rural areas bring in the lowest numbers in terms of total drivers, rides, and fares.
When we look at the average fare per driver, it is flipped. 
- Rural areas, the drivers average far more than in the Urban areas. 
- Suburban numbers are in the middle between the other two.
What can be seen from this data is that the Urban areas may do more rides and have more drivers but their averages are much lower than in the Rural areas. This can be due to distances traveled, rural areas tend to be larger areas of travel than in an Urban/big city set up.
## Summary
From the data results, we can gather what kind of fare will be had depending on the city type. The recommendations I have for Pyber are as follows:
- Ensuring in Rural areas there are enough drivers to handle demand
- In the Urban areas, set up pricing according to time of day and where they are going (i.e. sporting/entertainment event).
- Set up a system where the drivers will get paid accordingly depending on what city type they are driving in.
